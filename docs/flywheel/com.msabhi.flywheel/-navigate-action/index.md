# NavigateAction  
 [common] interface [NavigateAction](index.md) : [Action](../-action/index.md)

[NavigateAction](index.md) are specifically used for navigation. Though a [EventAction](../-event-action/index.md) can be used for the same purpose, it is provided to better differentiate between a event & a navigation.
